<blockquote>"Never allow someone to be your priority, while allowing yourself to be their option."</p></blockquote>
<p><cite><a href="https://twitter.com/ibmarcia/statuses/202096495787380736">Marcia Baczynski</a></cite></p>
<p>Although she's talking about romantic relationships, it's valuable advice for a contractor to heed too.</p>
<p><em>Note that "allow" is the operative word in that context.  For goodness sake, do make contractual agreements for granting special priority and for being compensated accordingly.  It's one of the crucial value-added services of what we do.</em></p>
