<p>
American Experience continues to fascinate. In the <a href="http://video.pbs.org/video/1309577149">episode on FDR's Civilian Conservation Corps</a>, interviewees attempt to put CCC into historical context:</p>
<ul>
<li>Created 3 million well-paid jobs during the Great Depression's record unemployment.</li>
<li>Educated 3 million men in everything from trades to basic literacy.</li>
<li>Created, or made radically more accessible, many state and federal parks.</li>
<li>Revived fallow farmlands, or turned them to pasture. Injected money into the economies of towns all over the country.</li>
<li>Moved families off soup lines by requiring that $25 of workers' $30 monthly salary automatically be sent home to the families.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most intriguing suggestion was that CCC's existence facilitated U.S. rapid mobilization for WWII because that was such a substantial pool of trained, disciplined young men to draw upon.ï»¿</p>
