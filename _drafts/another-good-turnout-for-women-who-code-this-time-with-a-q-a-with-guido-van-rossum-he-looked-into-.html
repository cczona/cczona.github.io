<p>Another good turnout for Women Who Code.  This time with a Q&amp;A with Guido van Rossum.  He looked into the crowd and declared it the biggest gathering of female geeks he&#039;s ever seen.  Which I have mixed feelings about.  On the one hand, great that we&#039;ve got this community of coders.  On the other hand, why is it NOT commonplace to see such gatherings at a size comparable to this?</p>
<p>Answering a question about what he would do differently if he were starting Python from scratch, Guido got a big gasp from the audience when he suggested that one would be using curly braces instead of whitespace.  Whoa.  I wish.</p>
<p>It also turns out he&#039;s quite a fan of Haskell; enough to lovingly criticize the heck out of it.</p>
