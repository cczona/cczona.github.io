<p>I was TextDrive VC38, and wrote the service&#039;s first documentation.  In exchange, I and 1000 or so other seed investors were promised &quot;lifetime hosting&quot; for &quot;as long as the company exists&quot;.  The company, now Joyent, this week announced that it&#039;s cancelling the contracts and giving just 80 days to migrate either to an expensive monthly account or to some other hosting company.  Either action requires significant investment of time to deal with transitioning all of one&#039;s sites.  Shoving customers off their servers is not nice to do on so little timeline and completely out of the blue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile over on Joyent&#039;s forums, Jason Hoffman -- who made those original contractual commitments as TextDrive&#039;s co-founder and is the current Joyent CEO axing them now -- has been making increasingly hostile snarks at those customer-investors.</p>
<p>Twitter and Joyent made their announcements on the same day.  What&#039;s up with companies deciding that the best business model for going forward is to show contempt for users and developers?  Crazy, yo.</p>

<p>Joyent ending &quot;Lifetime&quot; hosting accounts.<br />Some years ago when Joyent (then TexDrive) was young and strapped for cash they offered &quot;Lifetime&quot; hosting accounts apparently by &quot;lifetime&quot; they meant until we get tired of supporting them....... </p>
<p>Action Required:<br />Legacy Service End of Life</p>
<p>Dear Ken McKinney,</p>
<p>We&#039;ve been analyzing customer usage of Joyent’s systems and noticed that you are one of the few customers that are still on our early products and have not migrated to our new platform, the Joyent Cloud. </p>
<p>For many business reasons, including infrastructure performance, service quality and manageability, these early products are nearing their End of Life. We plan to sunset these services on October 31, 2012 and we&#039;d like to walk you through a few options.</p>
<p>We understand this might be an inconvenience for you, but we have a plan and options to make this transition as easy as possible.  We’ve been developing more functionality on our new cloud infrastructure, the Joyent Cloud, for our customers who care about performance, resiliency and security.  Now’s the time to take advantage of all the new capabilities you don’t have today. Everyone that’s moved to our new cloud infrastructure has been pleased with the results.  </p>
<p>We appreciate and value you as one of Joyent&#039;s lifetime Shared Hosting customers. As this service is one of our earliest offerings, and has now run its course, your lifetime service will end on October 31, 2012. However, we believe that you will enjoy the new functionalities of the Joyent Cloud. To show you our appreciation, as one of Joyent&#039;s lifetime Shared Hosting customers, we&#039;d like to offer you a free 512MB SmartMachine on the Joyent Cloud for one year. Use this promotional code to redeem the offer.</p>
<p>[Redacted]</p>
<p>Please review the Terms and Conditions for the Joyent Cloud One Year Free 512 MB Machine Promotion by visiting this link.</p>
<p>To find out more about the Joyent Cloud and your options, please follow this link to our migration center for additional details.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jason Hoffman<br />Founder and CTO<br />Joyent<br /><a href="mailto:jason@joyent.com" class="ot-anchor">jason@joyent.com</a></p>
