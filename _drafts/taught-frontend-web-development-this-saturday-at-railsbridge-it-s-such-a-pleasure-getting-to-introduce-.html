<p>Taught frontend web development this Saturday at Railsbridge. It&#039;s such a pleasure getting to introduce total n00bs to this stuff. They asked really insightful questions, which was exciting in itself.</p>
<p>For me, it was good to be challenged to consider these topics through beginners&#039; eyes. Wow is the syntax of HTML vs CSS vs JavaScript tricky when they&#039;re all coming at a learner at once; their first encounter altogether with markup or coding. It&#039;s an ambitious day, which includes forays into git, bash commandline, SSH, and GitHub.</p>
<p>In the teachers&#039; debriefing session afterward, we had a fascinating discussion about how the different class levels related to the curriculum&#039;s topics, and how to keep improving breadth and pacing. I hear one of the advanced classes worked on building a Twitter clone.</p>
<p>Just days left to finish prepping the Ruby on Rails backend Railsbridge workshop this Friday/Saturday (big thank you, <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a href="https://plus.google.com/116213423073098670227" class="proflink">Twitter</a></span>).</p>
<p>Oh, and we may have snazzy new Railsbridge sticker designs to hand out this weekend...</p>
