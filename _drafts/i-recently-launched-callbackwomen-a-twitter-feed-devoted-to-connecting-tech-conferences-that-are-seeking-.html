<p>I recently launched CallbackWomen, a Twitter feed devoted to connecting tech conferences that are seeking programmers as speakers, with the code women who are speakers are seeking opportunity.</p>
<p>CallbackWomen follows more than 150 conferences, and has already shared a long list of open CFPs. (Many of which are still open right now, by the way...)</p>
<p>What you can do:</p>
<p>* Encourage conference organizers to reach out directly to CallbackWomen, with CFP announcements. Many have found it particularly valuable to explicitly state their commitment to bringing in more proposals from women.</p>
<p>* Follow the CallbackWomen feed to spot new opportunities for you to propose talks. </p>
<p>* Browse the Follows list to discover interesting conferences that you haven&#039;t heard about yet.</p>
<p>* Suggest more conferences for CallbackWomen to Follow. (Curatorial note: limited to conferences which are primarily focused on programming topic and seek programmers as speakers.  The overall universe of tech conferences is too enormous to track.)</p>
<p>* Spread word to peers!</p>

<p>The latest from CallbackWomen (@CallbackWomen). Code women who are tech speakers. Programming conferences, shout out with Call for Proposals when you're looking for code women to callback to it</p>
