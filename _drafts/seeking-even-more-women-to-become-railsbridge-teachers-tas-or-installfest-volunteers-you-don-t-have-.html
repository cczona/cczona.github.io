<p>Seeking: even more women to become Railsbridge teachers, TAs, or installfest volunteers.  You don&#039;t have to be a &quot;ninja&quot;, &quot;guru&quot;, &quot;superstar&quot;, or &quot;expert&quot;.  If you&#039;ve been able to lean across the table and help a classmate or colleague troubleshoot now and then, you&#039;ve got the chops to be a valuable contributor.  </p>
<p>Bonuses: we train you beforehand, the curriculum is easy to present, we teach in teams (no worries about flying solo), we give you tons o&#039; support during events, and you get a free drink at the after-party. Also, participants appreciate the heck out of us.  You get to leave with a warm fuzzy glow of having brought excited newbies into the community.  Neat!</p>
