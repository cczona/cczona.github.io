<p>I&#039;m speaking October 21st at Confident Coding III (&quot;Everything Else You Need to Know&quot;), an all-day web technology education conference for women and friends. We&#039;ll be at Microsoft&#039;s San Francisco offices at Market &amp; Powell. Come join us for a fun day of learning about developer tools, automation, HTTP, the commandline, and more. Really useful stuff.</p>
<p>(Pssst. Women still earn 77% of what men do. Use discount code EQUALITY to register at 77% price.)</p>
