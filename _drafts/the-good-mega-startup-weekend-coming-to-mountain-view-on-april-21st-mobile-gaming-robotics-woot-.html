<p>The good: Mega Startup Weekend coming to Mountain View on April 21st! Mobile, gaming, robotics, woot! Make the products happen, y&#039;all.</p>
<p>The bad: recruitment problem in the current lineup of organizers, speakers, mentors, judges. <a href="http://mega.startupweekend.org/" class="ot-anchor">http://mega.startupweekend.org/</a> As best I can tell, just 2 of those 26 are women. For an event that&#039;s intended to foster new leadership and startup activity, of all things. (Yes, I&#039;ve contacted them, and specifically asked what they&#039;re doing to fix this. Please add your voice too. <a href="http://mega.startupweekend.org/contact/" class="ot-anchor">http://mega.startupweekend.org/contact/</a> Organizers need to know how many people notice, and care about, such issues) </p>
<p>The ugly: the weekend is co-sponsored by the otherwise terrific Women 2.0. At the Women 2.0 Startup Weekend in December, women were everywhere: developers, entrepreneurs, speakers, mentors, organizers, target markets... There&#039;s no shortage of smart women to draw on. Women 2.0 and the other sponsors should have insisted that the organizers dig deeper into the well before announcing.</p>
<p>Who else is underrepresented at this event, by the way? Doesn&#039;t seem to me that blacks leaders in the field are visible either. C&#039;mon, industry, we can and should do better.</p>
<p>EDIT: P.S. thanks go to Alaina for pointing out this, on a related note: <a href="http://snip.it/snips/113771" class="ot-anchor">http://snip.it/snips/113771</a></p>
