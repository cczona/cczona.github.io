<p>Off to a cookie swap/birthday party for a friend.  My contribution is adapted from grandma&#8217;s perennial Christmas classic, Angel Fingers:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/northbaywanderer/2145281777/" title="angel fingers by northbaywanderer, on Flickr" /></p>
<p><code><br />
1/2 c. butter, softened<br />
3 tbsp powdered sugar<br />
1/2 tsp vanilla powder<br />
1/4 tsp cinnamon<br />
pinch of nutmeg<br />
zest of 1 lemon, finely minced<br />
1/8 tsb almond extract<br />
1 c. cake flour<br />
1 c. nuts, chopped finely (walnuts, almonds, pistaschios, or pecans are excellent)<br />
lots of extra powdered sugar<br /></code></p>
<p>Cream the butter until fluffy.  Add sugar.  Cream more.</p>
<p>Add vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, &amp; almond extract.  Cream more.</p>
<p>Slowly sprinkle about half the zest into the flour, stirring well to separate and coat.  Gradually incorporate the flour/zest into the butter mixture.</p>
<p>Fold in nuts.</p>
<p>The mixture should be rather dry and crumbly.  If necessary add a little more flour.  <small>(Don&#8217;t worry about being exact.  The margin for error on the cake flour is pretty generous.  I&#8217;ve had these cookies come out well even with nearly twice this much flour.)</small></p>
<p>Refrigerate 15-30 minutes to firm up the butter a bit.  Preheat oven to 350.</p>
<p>Shape dough into crescents, roughly finger-sized.  Place on greased baking sheet or parchment-lined sheet.  Cook ~20mins just until set with light golden edges.</p>
<p>Cool briefly, about 5 minutes.  While still warm, roll in bowl of powdered sugar to coat.  Cool thoroughly before storing.</p>
<p>For a prettier finish, you can roll the cookies in powdered sugar a second time after they&#8217;ve completely cooled.  (For an extra zing, you can incorporate the leftover zest into the sugar before doing the second coat!)</p>
