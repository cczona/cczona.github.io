<p>UPDATE: Thank you to the huge number of responders. We&#039;ve secured a space! The workshop is continuing as scheduled.</p>
<p>PREVIOUSLY:<br />Due to unforeseen circumstances, the location where Railsbridge<br />Outreach Workshop for Women was going to host this week&#039;s workshop has fallen through. </p>
<p>If we can&#039;t secure a new location by 3pm today (4/26), we&#039;ll have to<br />cancel the workshop. Not only will this be a bummer for us organizers<br />who have been toiling to put on the event, it&#039;ll really, really suck<br />for all the folks that have signed up for this event and put effort<br />into preparing for it.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are reaching out to you to see if your<br />company can accommodate 60-80 people Friday night and all day<br />Saturday. If your company in SOMA, Downtown, or Financial District can<br />accommodate us, please contact me before 3pm today/Thursday.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Location - SOMA, Downtown, or Financial district; and walkable from<br />Muni, CalTrain, and BART.</p>
<p>Room Capacity - Railsbridge will have 40-50 students and 40-45<br />volunteers this weekend. We need 5 (or more, if available) breakout<br />rooms for them that are equipped with projector/adaptors, electrical<br />outlets, and guest wifi access.</p>
<p>Time needed - Friday 5pm -11pm (we&#039;ll hopefully be able to leave by<br />10, but need the buffer); Saturday 8:00am to 5:30pm (possibly as early<br />as 5pm).</p>
<p>Use of Facilities - Permission to use kitchen snacks/beverages would<br />be lovely, if the host company is amenable.</p>
<p>Sponsorship of food (nice to have; optional) - Food for Friday (pizza)<br />and Saturday (lunch, light breakfast). But Railsbridge can cover our<br />own food costs/arrangements if necessary.</p>
<p>Background info on Railsbridge can be found here:<br /><a href="http://railsbridge.org/" class="ot-anchor">http://railsbridge.org/</a><br /><a href="http://www.sfruby.info/events/60258772/" class="ot-anchor">http://www.sfruby.info/events/60258772/</a></p>
<p>We hope one of you can come through for us. Thank you for your<br />support of Railsbridge!</p>
