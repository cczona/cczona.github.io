<p>I get it, yes, Google I/O is coming to town and everyone&#039;s excited to piggyback their event to it.  At least a dozen excellent and genuinely substantial events I <i>really</i> would like to go to --  all competing for the same 2-3 hours of evening.  </p>
<p>Quit it.</p>
<p>You have something great to offer, and San Francisco can provide you with outstanding tech audiences every day of the year.  Scheduling on the 28th has unnecessarily forced us into the position of having to miss it.  At minimum, take note next time of how neglected the 27th, 29th (especially!), 30th are this year.</p>
