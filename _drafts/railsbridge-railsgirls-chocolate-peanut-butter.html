<p>Last week I had the privilege of being a coach for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.316521405099864.74569.100002260211918&type=3">the first U.S. workshop for RailsGirls</a>.  RailsGirls was co-founded  in Finland by Linda Liukas after she attended a RailsBridge workshop in San Francisco.  At first glance, the mission, format, and curricula of the two look pretty similar. Yet the details show how RailsGirls has evolved into its own unique thing.  The experiences do indeed differ.</p>
<p>First the similarities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Educational outreach focused on bringing more women into programming and their local Ruby/Rails developer communities.</li>
<li>Nearly all students are female; some workshops also have a few men.</li>
<li>Workshops are provided entirely free, with all expenses covered by sponsoring companies (supplemented occasionally other sources), hosted at companies or conferences that are connected to the Ruby/Rails scene, and staffed entirely by volunteers from the community.</li>
<li>The workshop starts on Friday evening with everyone getting their laptops setup with all the software you'll need. Then on Saturday, it's a full day of education.  Finally, the day winds down with an afterparty.</li>
</ul>
<p>RailsBridge is older, and the one I know best -- as observer, student, instructor, and these days as a workshop organizer. </p>
<p>RailsGirls (which was inspired by Railsbridge) has similar mission, and relatively similar format using a wholly different curriculum. Its co-founder, Linda Liukas, just moved to New York. No doubt she will be announcing a workshop there soon. But I bet it wouldn't hurt to put in a formal offer/request through their website.</p>
<p>Both organizations' workshops bring something valuable to any effort at addressing underrepresentation of women. RailsGirls is aimed at beginners exclusively, and tries to introduce concepts from the bigger picture of development lifecycle. RailsBridge workshops provide levels from novice to advanced, and the curriculum is more focused on Ruby and Rails than the broad range of associated professions/technologies. So they're addressing different scopes, albeit with a fair chunk of overlap.</p>
<p>Renee De Voursney, who previously organized a RailsBridge workshop in Seattle, is putting on a RailsBridge workshop next week in Berlin.  The event is organized/sponsored by RailsGirls Berlin.  The workshop schedule appears to be a hybrid.  Meanwhile, Daniel Choi is considering how to do a blended curriculum for his upcoming workshop in Boston too.  One of the organizers for that event also previously organized a RailsBridge event there.  Reese's Peanut Butter Cups used to have an ad campaign that fits well here.  Chocolate and peanut butter do make each other taste better.</p>
<p>With RailsBridge currently expanding to more European cities and RailsGirls poised to arrive all over the U.S. in coming months, I think we'll see more initiatives like this as local Ruby communities discover both opportunities exist.  It'll be interesting to see where this leads next.  I'm hoping to glean some lessons from both Renee, Liana, and Daniel; and ultimately do more of that experimentation.  Meanwhile, I'm organizing another RailsBridge workshop next month and will be organizing workshop #2 for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/434300269935017/">RailsGirls SF</a>.  Stay tuned.</p>
