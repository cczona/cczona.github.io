<p>At the last Women Who Code Lightening Talks, I presented "Cool Git Tricks (That I learn when things go badly)", a quick and cheeky intro to some very handy features that even experienced users are frequently unaware of. [<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/cczona/cool-git-tricks">SLIDES</a>] [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pgq0Yc3bJg">VIDEO</a>]</p>
<h3>Git information to your shell prompt?!</h3>
<p>Many said their favorite trick was the custom shell prompt (see the slides for how great this is).  They were awed that you can do that.  </p>
<p>Me too.  I'd first seen it in <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920017462.do">"McCullough and Berglund on Mastering Git"</a>, and had to know how the heck Matthew McCullough made his insaaaaane prompt. You've got to see it in action.</p>
<p>In fact, see the whole 5-hour video while you're at it.  Great for anyone who's been banging their head against Git for a while.  Earlier this year the team released a 4-hour followup to it, <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/video/software-engineering-and-development/version-control/9781449327354">McCullough and Berglund on Mastering Advanced Git</a>.</p>
<p>After seeing my Cool Git Tricks presentation, <a href="http://blog.sqisland.com/2012/08/bash-prompt.html">Chiu-Ki Chan was inspired to create her own Git prompt</a> and showed code examples of what she'd done.  Here's a Gist of the code for mine, while we're at it:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/3469469.js"> </script></p>
<p>Have fun playing with the examples Chiu-Ki and I have given.  Here's code for Matthew McCullough's <a href="https://gist.github.com/47267">Bash shell prompt</a> too while we're at it.</p>
<p>Learning how to customize your prompt like this is a tantalizing preview of what <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain">Git's low-level "plumbing"</a> makes possible.</p>
