<p>There's a lot of excitement currently about hacking Kinect for artistic/creative purposes.  Gray Area Foundation for the Arts (GAFFTA) has an intro workshop weekend coming up on March 3rd/4th.  Check it out, if you're curious:  <a href="http://www.gaffta.org/2011/12/19/kinect-for-unity/">Kinect for Unity 3D</a></p>
