<p>I hope GitHub leaps on the opportunity to integrate this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/bite-project/">Browser Integrated Testing Environment, or BITE</a>, is an open source Chrome Extension which aims to fix the manual web testing experience.&hellip;  When filing a bug, BITE automatically grabs screenshots, links, and problematic UI elements and attaches them to the bug.&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;[E]very action the tester takes on the page is recorded in JavaScript, and can be played back later.  This enables engineers to quickly determine if the steps of a bug repro in a specific environment, or whether a code change has resolved the issue.</p>
<p>Also included in BITE is a Record/Playback console to automate user actions in a manual test.</p>
