<p>Handy trick, courtesy of Aaron Blohowiak on ruby-6:</p>
<p><code>$ gem install open_gem<br />
$ gem open [gem_name]</code></p>
<p>The entire gem's codebase is opened into your favorite editor, as defined by the shell variable EDITOR.</p>
<p><code>$ echo EDITOR<br />
vi<br />
$ $EDITOR = emacs<br />
$ echo EDITOR<br />
emacs<br />
</code></p>
<p>My own choice is actually <a href="http://macromates.com">TextMate</a> (mate).  But fewer people have that already on their system.</p>
<p>By the way, if you're using the <a href="http://gembundler.com/">Bundler</a> gem, your working directory includes a Gemfile file or Gemfile is further up its path, and <code>bundle install</code> is current, then you can do this instead:</p>
<p><code>$ bundle open [gem_name]<br />
</code></p>
<p>Somewhat less useful to me.  Sometimes I just want to poke around inside a lib.  It's not necessarily one in active use at that moment.  But choose whatever approach fits your workflow best.</p>
