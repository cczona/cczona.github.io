<p>Two welcome announcements this week:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://kennethreitz.com/xcode-gcc-and-homebrew.html">Apple has just released the XCode UNIX tools, including GCC, as a<br />
standalone 171MB package for Lion users.</a>  Crucially, it includes the C headers not previously available with Kenneth Reitz's workaround.  Which should solve <a href="2011/12/fixing-the-you-have-to-install-development-tools-first-error-when-installing-certain-rubygems-under-lion/">some problems Homebrew had been having.</a></p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/3664060">As of Ruby 1.9.3-p125, MRI now has LLVM/Clang compilation support</a>
</li>
</ul>
