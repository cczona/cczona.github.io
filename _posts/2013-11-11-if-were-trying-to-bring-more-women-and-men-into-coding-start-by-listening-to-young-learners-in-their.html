<p>If we&#039;re trying to bring more women and men into coding, start by listening to young learners in their own words. These have shared useful insights, for instance. Understanding what drives their interest is critical, not just as future coders themselves (we hope!) but also as reps for a future cohort of consumers for tech products that speak to their interests/needs.</p>
