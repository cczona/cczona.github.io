<p>Ever commit to repo and then belatedly realize that the authorship metadata isn't what it should be?  Easy to do when pair programming.</p>
<p><a href="http://help.github.com/change-author-info/">Here's a nifty little script for fixing authorship of commits within a Git repository.</a>  It uses a Git plumbing command called <var>filter-branch</var>.</p>
<p>Consider the GitHub-provided script a starting point for your own, rather than a copy/paste solution.  <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/git-filter-branch">Read filter-branch's documentation</a> carefully before using.  <var>filter-branch</var> changes the SHA-1 value of any commits affected, which means that every descendant commit's SHA-1 will also be re-written.  Of course, there are also the usual caveats about the pitfalls of changing history on a shared repo.</p>
