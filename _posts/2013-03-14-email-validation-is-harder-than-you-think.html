<p>I got asked recently about email validation: <q><em>is "+" valid?</em></q></p>
<p>Yes, the plus sign is a legal character in an email address.  Though even if it were not, you'd do well to accept that character since it's used by millions of Gmail users:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/144397/instant-disposable-gmail-addresses">Lifehacker, 2012</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Many surprising characters are legal in an email address.  Pretty much everybody gets email validation wrong.</p>

</ul>
<p>If you still want to take a shot at evaluate the correctness of an email address string, at least do it with library that uses a parser and has attempted (nevertheless imperfectly) the  difficult task of complying with all the relevant RFCs.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cczona/mail/tree/master/lib/mail/parsers">Ruby</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.dominicsayers.com/2011/03/email-address-validation/">PHP</a></li>
</ul>
