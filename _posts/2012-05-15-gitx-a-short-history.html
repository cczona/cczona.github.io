<h3>In the beginning there was GitX</h3>
<p>I keep meeting developers who still use the old GitX developed by pieter, unaware there's anything newer.  Head's up: it hasn't had a new commit for 3 years.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"This fork is no longer active."</em> <cite><a href="https://github.com/pieter/gitx/wiki">(wiki)</a></cite></p></blockquote>
<h3>And it begat children</h3>
<p>Two forks arose in its place.  Both added substantial new feature sets, taking slightly different approaches. </p>
<p>One of these, <a href="https://github.com/brotherbard/gitx/tree/9dd29f6048525481a761a80a60c2da6b60e8a734">brotherbard's GitX</a>, has since fallen by the wayside too; its last commit was a year and a half ago.</p>
<p>Whereas the other successor, <a href="http://gitx.laullon.com">German Laullon's GitX(L)</a> remains under very active development.  This quarter alone, there have been a couple dozen commits including accepting 10 pull requests from other developers.  The <a href="http://gitx.laullon.com/">GitX(L) homepage</a> currently lists 90 contributors including brotherbard himself.</p>
<p>This is what open source excels at.  Someone abandoned a project, and others rolled with it.  Consensus built up around one of the forks, and a community has sprung up to keep it thriving.</p>
<p>Upgrade to GitX(L), if you haven't already.  It's gotten some really nice enhancements along the way.</p>
<h3>And one of those begat a child too</h3>
<p>The story doesn't end with GitX(L) either.  It's been forked too, by a new project called <a href="https://github.com/rowanj/gitx">GitX(R)</a> which is focusing on</p>
<blockquote><p>"&hellip;working with the latest tools for developing software for current Apple platforms. As such, it only supports 64-bit Intel macs, and currently deploying versions of OS X and Xcode&hellip; [W]e are prioritizing moving away from deprecated or unreliable technologies like a dependency on command-line git usage to drive GitX features; and staying up-to-date with Apple and third-party frameworks and libraries that are used."</p></blockquote>
<p>In practice only Lion or higher is supported ("Snow Leopard may or may not work"), plus XCode 4.3 is strongly recommended.</p>
<p>Some of the folks I teach or collaborate with are Snow Leopard users.  So for the moment I'm sticking with GitX(L) for those brief times when we need to flip over to a GUI. But the ongoing story of GitX is good for everybody.</p>
<p>Pick your favorite poison.  If not one of the GitX forks, goodness knows there are <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/4692128/893498">plenty of other options</a>.</p>
<p>UPDATE: GitX(R) is now named GitX-dev</p>
