<p><a href="http://glutenfreegirl.com/david-leites-chocolate-chip-cookies-gluten-free/">This recipe for gluten-free chocolate chip cookies</a> is nearly perfect, once the (bleck!) sorghum is substituted out in favor of almond flour. I don't stock amaranth, so swap in brown rice flour or millet flour there. And, wow, does the salt content need to be dialed back several notches.</p>
<p>It produces a nice chewy-on-the-inside-crumbly-on-the-outside cookie at 350 degrees. Normally I am hugely biased toward gooey when it comes to baked goods. But this dough turns sublime when baked to a meringue cookie-like crispness at 200 degrees. The difficulty there is that it takes ages to bake, while filling the house with irresistible aroma. Not fair.ï»¿</p>
