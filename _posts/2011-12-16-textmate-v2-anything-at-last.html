<p>After years of being vaporware, TextMate 2.x is out. Well, in alpha. But it exists.</p>
<p>We'll see whether it's too late. SublimeText, among others, has been attracting a lot of notice lately for features that even TM 2.0 won't. Crucially, they also are farther ahead in offering Lion support.</p>
<p>But as a TextMate user, any new release is very good news.ï»¿</p>
