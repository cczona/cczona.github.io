<p>I'm speaking October 21st at <a href="http://confidentcoding.com/">Confident Coding III ("Everything Else You Need to Know")</a>, an all-day web technology education conference for women and friends. We'll be at Microsoft's San Francisco offices at Market & Powell. Join us for a fun day of learning about developer tools, automation, HTTP, the commandline, and more. Really useful stuff.  Come!</p>
<p>(Pssst. Women still earn 77% of what men do. Use discount code EQUALITY to register at 77% price.)</p>
<p>Updated: Here's the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/cczona/full-stack-full-circle-what-the-heck-happens-in-an-http-requestresponse-cycle">slides for "Full Stack & Full Circle: What the Heck Happens In an HTTP Request-Response Cycle"</a></p>
