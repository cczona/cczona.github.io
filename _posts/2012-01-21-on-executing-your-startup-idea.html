<blockquote>
<p>"Talk about your idea. Many entrepreneurs I meet are worried others will steal their idea if they tell too many people. In reality, most people are way too busy with their own job or idea to bother stealing yours. Plus, ideas aren't worth much (unless it's super easy to implement, in which case you should stop talking and just do it). Execution is what distinguishes winners from losers.</p>
<p>Talking about your idea will give you valuable feedback that can help you improve your execution. Talking about stuff you're passionate about will help you attract people who can help you with your idea or introduce you to others who can help."</p>
