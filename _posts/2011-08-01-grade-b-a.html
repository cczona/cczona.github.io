Booyah. Grade B maple syrup is being stocked at Trader Joe's. Usually it's hard to find on this coast, so it was a nice surprise to find it in large supply.﻿</p>
<p>The public has been bamboozled into paying through the nose for grade A, which is vastly inferior.</p>
<p>Inexpensive maple-y goodness, hi ho!﻿</p>
