<p>Done!  Submitted my very first commit for the official Ruby documentation.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Oh so nerve-wracking to submit a commit to the ruby/ruby repo, even a documentation fix. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23missionaccomplished">#missionaccomplished</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23whoohoo">#whoohoo</a>!</p>

<p>Patting myself on the back for having spotted the error.  It was over 2 months old &mdash; surprising for a standard library like URI::HTTP.  So I second-guessed myself initially.</p>
<p><small><em>Surely that doc gets scrutinized by hundreds of people daily.  <small>Surely someone else would have spotted it ages ago, if it were done incorrectly.  <small>Surely I just haven't heard about some fancy new syntactical construct.  <small>Surely the fact that the example doesn't work for me is because I must've done something incorrectly.  Surely.</small></small></small></em></small></p>
<p>That voice in the back of the head is noise from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">imposter syndrome</a>.  <strong>Shut up, you.</strong></p>
<p>Doubt like this depends too on believing that those who have contributed to Ruby are infallible. A mythbuster, for me and for you:</p>
<blockquote><p><code>$ cd ruby-official-repo<br />
$ git log | grep -ic "typo"<br />
842</code></p></blockquote>
<p>Trust your instinct.  Verify.  Make better things happen.  Commit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Last month I also made a first commit for the official Rails documentation, and &mdash; hooray! &mdash; it was accepted.  Though not without a brief <em>facepalm</em> moment when I accidentally submitted a big bunch of other people's commits with it.  Luckily, the railsdocs repository is maintained separately from the Rails codebase.  So it was a quick fix by doing <code>git reset --HARD</code> on master branch then the documentation maintainers and I each did a <code> git push -f</code> on our respective repos, and rebased my branch's commit back in.  Voila, solved.</p>
<p>It's a good example of where Git is a big win for contributor, maintainers, and collaborators.  It is also a good example of how wins like these are made easiest when developers are required to submit to an upstream via a branch rather than on top of master.</p>
<p>So, summary: I can now put "Rails documentation contributor" on the résumé, and hopefully soon will be able to put "Ruby documentation contributor" on it too.  Don't worry; even though I'm a cool kid now, I still want to hang out with you.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Mission accomplished. What fun.</p>
