<p>Went to CodeRetreat to be challenged by newness. That it did. Attempting to define a workable solution, and implement it, in very limited time and with a stranger as pair partner. Twice had pairings in which we shared no common programming language. Everyone has distinctly different styles of communicating, and of course has their own favorite IDE.</p>
<p>A swift dive into multiple levels of unfamiliarity. Challenge, ahoy.</p>
<p>Learned a lot, especially from the partner discussions and group debriefings. Not just about coding, but also a valued exploration of what it takes to succeed at this kind of collaboration. Mulling over.ï»¿</p>
