<p>Dear Restauranteur:</p>
<p>You are very pleased with your site's dazzling Flash-based interface, aren't you? Stop. Please, just stop, for your own sake. Use HTML. Put your phone number, address on every page. Post the menu; also in HTML. Fall out of love with uber-snazziness, and give me super-easy access to the info that lets me buy a meal from you. We will all be happier.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
