<p>I'm getting back up to speed on Ruby and Rails.</p>
<p>I learned back in the era of Ruby 1.8 and Rails 1.1.*. TDD and BDD were just emerging as topics of serious interest within the community. Oh, ye olden days!</p>
<p>I didn't use the skills for a couple of years, so they'd fallen fallow. Meanwhile, Ruby 1.9 introduced some syntactical changes that are backwards-incompatible and Rails, at 3.*, is apparently a different beast altogether. Between the three, it seemed best to start education over from beginner. No doubt uptake this time will go much quicker.</p>
<p>I'm enjoying the Ruby Koans. They're stirring fond memories of The Little Schemer. The koans are kind of a hippy-dippy, cheat-sheet included, test-driven, Little Schemer Lite.</p>
<p>The Little Schemer was considerably more challenging and abstract/conceptual. But both teach through code itself; an uncommon approach, that keeps my mind happily engaged with problem-solving. Any recommendations for more advanced Ruby tutorials that use similar methodology? (_why's guide drove me crazy last time, FYI)ï»¿</p>
