<div class="link_description">
<p>Oh bloody hell.  Why didn&#8217;t someone tell me about this eons ago.  My commandline just got sweet:</p>
<p><code>port install bash-completion</code></p>
<p>Can&#8217;t remember a command flag?  Bash will prompt with all the available options.   Tired of typing a hostnames for every SSH login?  Bash will complete it for you.  And on, and on&#8230;  Heaven.</p>
<p>And it only gets better after you set <a href="http://rumour.biology.gatech.edu/Computers/cdpath.shtml">CDPATH</a> to a few of your favorite directories.  I may never have to type a full path again.</p>
<p>Can we get this for browsers, please?  Their whole-line autocomplete is so primitive by comparison.</p>
