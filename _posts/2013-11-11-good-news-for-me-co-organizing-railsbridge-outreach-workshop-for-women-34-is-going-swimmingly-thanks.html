<p>Good news for me: co-organizing Railsbridge Outreach Workshop for Women #34 is going swimmingly thanks to <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a href="https://plus.google.com/115894880178771991476" class="proflink">Amy L.</a></span> &amp; <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a href="https://plus.google.com/101117479627038298551" class="proflink">Tina Lee</a></span>. We rock as a team. Tina and I are discovering that the Railsbridge community has done a bang-up job of documenting what we need.</p>
<p>Good news for you: that makes two events for April! The frontend intro workshop with HTML/CSS/JavaScript is on 4/21 at +Twilio, then we&#039;re giving the backend intro workshop with Ruby on Rails on 4/28 at +Twitter.</p>
<p>Sign up ASAP. Don&#039;t be intimidated by the wait list. A lot of people get moved up before the big day.</p>
