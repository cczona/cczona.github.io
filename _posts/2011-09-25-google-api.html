<p>Google cleverly has chosen to make their G+ API read-only. So if you want to publish once to hit multiple downstreams, gee-willikers looks like you'll just have to do that from Google+.</p>
<p>If the goal is to increase community size and loyalty, ditching the hostility toward nyms would be a far more productive way to go about it.</p>
<p>(And releasing a kickass <em>bi-directional</em> API would eliminate a lot of wariness about migrating.)ï»¿</p>
