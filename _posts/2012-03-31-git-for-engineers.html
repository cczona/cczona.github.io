<p>Well this is an interesting approach.  If you haven't related to previous tutorials about Git, maybe <a href="http://sitaramc.github.com/gcs/index.html">Git for Engineers</a> is what you've needed.</p>
<p>(On a tangentially-related note: <a href="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/">Cooking for Engineers</a>. At minimum, check out "Bacon, parts <a href="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/article/3/Bacon-Part-I">1</a> and <a href="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/article/110/Bacon-Part-II">2</a>").</p>
