<blockquote>My coding skill improved a lot when I started wondering before implementing somethingÂ <em>how am I going to document this thing</em>.</p>
<p>"Thing" here should have all the possible granularity. From the method to the whole product. For instance at the method level it prevents adding a method in the API that doesn't fit, or is unclear, before actually writing it. And if I really need to implement a method I cannot document (easily), it's a sign there is a design problem somewhere...</p>
<p>Automatically, the attitude "<em>if I can't explain it, I don't write it</em>" filters out bad code and conversely once I know how to document correctly a thing, it becomes simpler and cleaner to implement.<br />
