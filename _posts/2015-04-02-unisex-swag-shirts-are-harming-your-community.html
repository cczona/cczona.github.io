<p>"Shirts! We've got your t-shirts right here!"</p>
<p>Except we don't. </p>
<p>No one is entitled to freebies. But let's talk about why we're fond of giving free shirts to (presumably) well-paid people anyway.</p>
<p>I'm a developer evangelist & community builder. When it comes to software, "community" can feel like an abstraction. What does "community" even mean, right?</p>
<p>_A community is comprised of people who share an attribute that's important to them, that feels distinct from those who don't have it in common, and which is tied to a sense of personal identity._</p>
<p>"I live in San Francisco" is a statement of geographical fact; whereas "I am a San Franciscan" reflects an aspect of my identity. My sense of belonging to something that will outlast me. My passion & loyalties. San Francisco is my community. I feel this way about other things, too. Ruby community has its flaws, but it's a community I am invested in long-term regardless of what else I'm doing.</p>
<p>"What does this have to do with t-shirts?" you might be wondering.</p>
<p>Let's circle back to the question of why the heck we give away swag shirts. Some reasons:</p>
<p>* We need people's passive help in getting the project or brand known better.<br />
* We want people to associate the project or brand with being cool, whether anyone knows anything else about it whatsoever.<br />
* We want people to feel appreciated, and feel that others are being treated well too.<br />
* We hope people feel proud to wear our logo; proud to be associated with it.<br />
* We intend that when someone sees a crowd full of people wearing the shirt, that they'll feel they're missing out and be excited to go do something about it.<br />
* We intend that it'll ultimately lead to questions, usage, contributions, and personal identification.</p>
<p>_Every time someone walks away with a shirt that doesn't fit them right, or there's no shirt to fit them at all, that's a lose-lose situation for us all._</p>
<p>* A failure to elicit help bolstering the image of the project or brand.<br />
* A thoughtless decision that looks decidedly uncool.<br />
* Showing due appreciation to some, while disregarding others who equally deserve appreciation.<br />
* Implicitly communicating that some people needn't take interest in what we're building.<br />
* Making people feel they're missing out, then reinforcing the accuracy of that conclusion.</p>
<p>It is possible to build software community without caring about swag shirt inclusivity; but it makes that mission unnecessarily harder.</p>
<p>ere's [a nice writeup about gender-inclusive shirts](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/T-shirts). It details what swag shirt inclusivity entails. Swag shirt inclusivity goes beyond gender considerations, but it's a solid start. </p>
<p>Yep, this stuff takes effort to do well. But it serves a community builder's mission.</p>
