<p>Someone casually mentioned that <kbd>Control-R</kbd> impresses a lot of people.  Hmm.  I do not know this one&hellip;.</p>
<p>Oh holy heck. <a href="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/08/15-examples-to-master-linux-command-line-history"> <kbd>Control-R</kbd> is so bloody useful for searching Bash shell history.</a>  Look at all the keystrokes I've been wasting with <code>history | grep -i whatever</code>.  Not to mention then typing the selected line's number.</p>
<p>Who cares that it impresses.  Productivity!</p>
