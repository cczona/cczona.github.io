<p>On a search for something else, I stumbled across this oldie: <em><a href="http://james-iry.blogspot.com/2009/05/brief-incomplete-and-mostly-wrong.html">A Brief, Incomplete, and Mostly Wrong History of Programming Languages</a></em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>"1995 - At a neighborhood Italian restaurant, Rasmus Lerdorf realizes that his plate of spaghetti is an excellent model for understanding the World Wide Web and that web applications should mimic their medium. On the back of his napkin he designs Programmable Hyperlinked Pasta (PHP). PHP documentation remains on that napkin to this day."</p></blockquote>
<p>Now I'm having flashbacks to old Drupal internals.ï»¿</p>
