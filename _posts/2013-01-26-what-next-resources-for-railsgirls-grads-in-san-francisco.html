<p>In an average month, San Francisco's SOMA neighborhood is host to more than 30 workshops, classes, and study groups that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>specifically for women to learn programming, maintain ongoing study, and enter the profession;</li>
<li>provided by professional programmers, who teach and mentor for the sheer darned pleasure of sharing what they know and expanding the community; and</li>
<li>all of it either completely free or else low-cost (with up to 100% scholarships available for the latter, as needed)</li>
</ul>
<p>And thosre are just the ones about the principal languages of the Rails stack: Ruby, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>
<aside><em>* P.S. Most throw in a free meal or two.  Several offer free childcare upon request too.</em></aside></p>
<p>Yes, 30 events per month that meet <em>all</em> of those criteria.</p>
<p>So many opportunities to see, do, learn, teach, lead, mentor.</p>
<p>This weekend I had the pleasure of volunteering at yet another of these local events.  RailsGirls held its second workshop in San Francisco; another organization easing into this vibrant mix.  Welcome, RailsGirls grads!  <a href="http://cczona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/RailsGirlsSF-what-next1.pdf">Here's a couple slides introducing you to the abundance of local answers to "What's next?"</a>  I hope we'll get to see you again, soon, at several of 'em.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Fixed the hashtag. Added 2 more resources.</p></p>
