<p><a href="https://joindiaspora.com/">Diaspora*</a>; is a Ruby on Rails-based distributed social networking open source project. New to open source coding? Welcome to <a href="http://devblog.joindiaspora.com/2012/01/30/introducing-bug-mash-monday/">Diaspora* Bug Mash Mondays</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We've sorted through our GitHub issues to find bugs that can be readily fixed and committed by beginners&hellip;</p>
<p>Every Monday, 5 bugs with descriptions and links will be posted on the devblog, inviting anyone out in the community to jump in and do their part. At the end of each week, we'll publicly recognize those community members that jumped in on the blog itself, and if your fixes pass testing, we'll accept it into our mainline branch.</p>
<p>Bug Mashing is a great way to welcome in new blood to the community."</p>
