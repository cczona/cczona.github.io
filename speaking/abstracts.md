### Data of the Dead

App development rarely envisions, let alone designs for, death. Yet it's a factor that has complicated influence on users. So it's necessary that it likewise influence how we approach features, security, and policies.

When a loved one dies, there are people who hoping to maintain access to the digital mementos that we hold of the person. Some people need direct access to the departed's accounts.

What are our responsibilities to the departed and to the living? What about when someone is not gone but incapacitated? Or when a person's death has has cultural impact? Or when legal and administrative requirements conflict with human needs of those who are grieving? What about when the dead aren't our apps' users, but the people taking respite from thinking about them? Uncomfortable questions. 

We can balance our legitimate practical concerns -- such as risk of social engineering -- with compassion for people who are grappling with tech complications while in mourning. But few of use know what proven approaches exist for us to draw upon. We'll examine questions, solutions, amd design patterrns. You'll take away practical approaches to this human factor, and successfully code for it.
